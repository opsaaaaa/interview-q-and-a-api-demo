# About Me

My name is Sean Ferney, im a ruby on rails programer and this completed assessment is my work.


## Doing the assessment

I started by pulling the original assessment. I spending some time matching rails and bundler versions and fixing broken dependencies, I also experimented with updating rails. I decided it would be more effective to start from a new clean project and meet the assessment specifications with that instead. 
Working with out older versions of rails takes more debugging time. Thats fine on the clock, but on my own time I would rather use an up-to-date version of rails.
That also gave me a chance use my preferred setup, with tools like rspec and factory bot. It also avoids issues with documentations versions.

I tend to be a TDD oriented programer. I wrote most of the project using tests before I even booted the rails server. Making requests with postman has always felt inconvenient to me. When I am writing an API I prefer to use request specs fist.

This was my first time implementing api_key based authentication.
