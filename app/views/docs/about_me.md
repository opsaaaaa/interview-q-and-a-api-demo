# About Me

My name is Sean Ferney, im a ruby on rails programer and this completed assessment is my work.


## Doing the assessment

I started by pulling the original assessment but after spending some time matching ruby and bundler and fixing broken dependencies, I decided it would be more effective to start from a new clean project and meet the assessment specifications with that instead.

That also gave me a chance to use rspec, allows me to use the newer convinces in rails, and avoids issues with documentations versions.

I tend to be a TDD oriented programer. I wrote most of the project using tests before I even booted the rails server. Making requests with postman has always felt inconvenient to me. When I am writing an API I prefer to use request specs fist.
